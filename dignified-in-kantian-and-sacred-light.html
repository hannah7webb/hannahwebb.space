  <h4 style="font-weight: 700;">Introduction: A Misalignment</h4>
  <h4>Truth is like the common thread that weaves society together–an essential yet elusive principle of human interaction and institutional function: an author must cite reliable sources to provide credibility to his or her argument, the court of law is structured to use truthful accounts to determine consequences, and a marriage hinges on a mutual basis of trust to sustain itself. Thus, truth is an instrument that provides mankind with the ability to draw distinct boundaries in various veins of his life: academically, civically, relationally, etc. These objective frameworks pave the way for human advancement, whether by using the accumulated knowledge of biology to improve medicine, unfiltered public discussion to develop a deeper understanding of one another, or even authentic relationships to sustain and grow society.</h4>
  <h4>Yet, at the same time, man is impulsive and occasionally irrational. It is the moment that his impulsivity overcomes his truth-seeking, that misinformation crises manifest. The earliest forms of these crises date back to biblical times and have perpetuated throughout the history of the West. Yet, regardless of what these crises surround, they all originate from the same fundamental problem: sacrificing integrity of information to obtain a personal advantage or desire. Additionally, examining these crises reveals the sheer magnitude of destruction that truth breaches can cause—shattered relationships, false accusations, and the loss of innocent lives.</h4>
  <h4>Today, the spread of misinformation has evolved, only instead, on an unprecedentedly large scale. While new technological systems like artificial intelligence enhance the efficiency of man’s daily life, they have altered the way humans typically absorb and filter through information, promoting the instantaneous spread of false headlines, commentary, deep fakes, and various forms of unregulated, AI-generated content. In the face of a technology he is yet to understand how to use, truth has become incredibly elusive to the modern man, altering his core identities: misinformation fueled by AI is diminishing the integrity of academia and man’s ability to hold productive democratic discussion. Plus, chatbots are beginning to blur the lines between authentic and simulated human interaction, gamifying the connection humans desperately need.</h4>
  <h4>In a word, historically, misinformation crises illustrate that man’s impulsive nature leads to the erosion of truth. As AI technology fuels man’s impulsivity, new cracks are forming in his identity as a civilian, scholar, and connector, revealing that one of man’s fundamental purposes in life is to seek truth. As a species that advances on the very basis of truth-seeking, what will happen to human progress when machine learning models continue to nurture man’s impulsive nature? To maximize the benefits reaped from human innovation and AI technologies, man must recognize the misalignment between the teleological function of AI and the inherent purpose that lies within himself, adjusting accordingly.</h4>
  
  <h4 style="font-weight: 700;">Absolutism vs Relativism</h4>
  <h4>Before delving into misinformation crises, it is important to grasp the nature of truth itself, so one can understand exactly which definition of truth is being violated. Philosophically, there are two main ways to approach truth’s nature in the world: absolutely or relatively. Greek philosopher Plato is an absolutist, meaning that he embraces the idea that a truth beyond man’s lived experience is definite and confirmed. Conversely, relativists argue that no truth is known for certain, but that it fluctuates over time as the world changes. Whereas absolutists focus on the metaphysical in their understanding of reality, relativists believe that man-made constructs such as power, wealth, and reputation should be taken into account in understanding the truths of societies.</h4>
  <h4>Thus, the two opposing views of truth stand in stark contrast to one another. Plato focuses on the idea that there is a constant reality in the world that is unchanging no matter how man evolves, and relativists rely on the idea that reality changes as a result of the actions of mankind. Relativists believe that there is no steady philosophical footing for mankind, but only a truth defined by the group in the present moment. The view that man progresses by compounding a series of truths over time assumes absolutism–the existence of inflexible universals. Therefore, the tracing of misinformation over time will acknowledge that the truths violated are not relative to the period, but rather absolute.</h4>

  <h4 style="font-weight: 700;">Subjective vs Objective Truth</h4>
  <h4>Observing truth on a smaller scale than an overarching philosophical framework requires defining the specific type of truth under discussion. According to Plato, there are two types of truths: objective and subjective. He teaches that objective truths are understandings of the world that are irrefutable–that hold a direct correspondence to reality, and subjective truths, are opinions humans form based on individual experiences. Plato’s Allegory of the Cave illustrates subjective truths as the mere shadows within a cave people observe, shadows they are limited to seeing due to being chained to the ground and unable to turn their heads. What casts these shadows are real objects, light from the outside world projecting a distorted shape of them into the inside of the cave. </h4>
  <h4>The allegory is representative of man’s flawed senses that deceive him in his subjective perception of the world. Plato illustrates this subjectivity in contrast to an external world that the prisoners are unaware of–a world full of real objects and knowledge that can only be discovered only through intellectual inquiry, or what he calls the pursuit of the “Idea of the Good.” When discussing how truth has progressed, the argument will predominantly focus on the evolution of objective truths rather than subjective truths, focusing on universal truths and structures that are not as variable as Plato’s definition of subjective truths.</h4>

  <h4 style="font-weight: 700;">Theories of Truth</h4>
  <h4>When discussing the implications of a misinformation crisis, it is presumed that there is some line between truth and falsity, and therefore, to identify when something is in alignment or violation of truth the definition of truth itself must be established. The argument will operate about truth in its alignment with the correspondence theory. Today the correspondence theory is known as the literal or “real version” of truth. Stanford’s Encyclopedia of Philosophy states that in its simplest form, the theory can be defined as the following: “x is true if x corresponds to some fact; x is false if x does not correspond to any fact.” </h4>
  <h4>Many philosophers agree with the correspondence theory merely due to its obviousness. For example, Descartes says that he has “never had any doubts about truth, because it seems a notion so transcendentally clear that nobody can be ignorant of it...the word ‘truth’, in the strict sense, denotes the conformity of thought with its object.” Similarly, William James expresses that “truth, as any dictionary will tell you, is a property of certain of our ideas. It means their ‘agreement,’ as falsity means their disagreement, with ‘reality.’” Establishing truth as defined by the correspondence theory provides a clear discernibility between truth and falsity. Yet, other theories of truth define truth differently. For example, the constructivist theory defines truth as the “moral principles we ought to accept are the ones that agents would agree to or endorse were they to engage in a hypothetical or idealized process of rational deliberation” (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy). In brief, constructivism suggests that truth is constructed by society rather than something inherent. The consensus theory similarly bases truth on the subjective understandings of humans–defining truth as a series of “social agreements” (Oxford Reference). Thus, the correspondence theory assumes that truth is objective whereas other definitions, in part, assume truth is rooted in subjective experiences. The key reason why the following misinformation crises will be analyzed under the correspondence theory is that, as the next sections will reveal, the problem of misinformation often arises when man interprets subjective truths as fact as a means of catering to his impulsivity.</h4>

  <h4 style="font-weight: 700;">Misinformation in the Bible</h4>
  <h4>By analyzing previous misinformation crises, it is evident that each stems from instances in which man begins to prioritize his impulsivity over truth. Some of the earliest forms of misinformation can be found in the Bible. The stories of the Bible reveal that humans find pleasure in embracing perversions because it is easier for man to heed his flesh than to seek truth. The beginning of the Bible opens with a story in which Eve is persuaded by Satan to eat a forbidden fruit in the garden of Eden. Despite God’s stating prior that if she touched the forbidden fruit she would die, Satan says to Eve that surely she will not die “for God knows that when [she eats] of it [her] eyes will be opened and [she] will be like God, knowing good and evil” (Genesis 3:5). When she saw that “the fruit of the tree was pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it” (Genesis 3:6). In the story, Eve’s desire for knowledge and power overcomes her ability to obey the truth God initially presented to her, demonstrating humans’ inherent nature to overlook the objective for what seems more visually attractive or beneficial.</h4>
  <h4>Another Biblical story demonstrating man’s tendency to overlook facts out of one’s flesh is when the Pharisees persecuted Jesus. Despite knowing that Jesus’ miracles were legitimate, the Pharisees were not concerned about whether or not Jesus was or was not the son of God, but only about their political status. In a meeting the Pharisees call, they ask, “What are we accomplishing? [...] Here is this man performing many miraculous signs. If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.” (John 11:47-48). Therefore, though the Pharisees recognize that Jesus’ acts are irrefutable, they are primarily concerned with Jesus as a threat to their political standing, choosing to revel in a false reality. On the whole, Biblical stories illustrate an early recurring theme in civilization of humans succumbing to misinformation in exchange for pursuing their desires and personal satisfaction.</h4>

  <h4 style="font-weight: 700;">Misinformation in the West</h4>
  <h4>A similar thread of impulsivity’s erosion of truth is revealed by analyzing Western misinformation crises. Amidst the West’s diverse history of misinformation, one prevalent example was the Salem Witch Trials of 1692, in which colonists of Massachusetts accused over 200 people of practicing witchcraft, otherwise known as the devil’s magic, resulting in the execution of 20 citizens. The trials are attributed to the sense of paranoia and injustice that many early settlers adopted, along with the strong religious influences that taught that the devil would select certain people to carry out harm to others; these people were known as witches. Questioning to determine whether one was practicing witchcraft was notoriously unfair and driven by fear rather than tangible evidence. The first person accused of witchcraft during the trials was a woman named Bridget Bishop. Her gossipy habits and promiscuity prompted her questioning, and despite stating that she was as “innocent as a child unborn,” the defense did not find her case to be convincing and she was later hanged as punishment. Many paintings that documented the trials even suggest that the artists were sympathetic to those accused based on the gentle depictions of the convicted. The trials are a testament to unchecked emotion’s ability to intervene in man’s critical decision-making, overriding his sense of logic and truth. People’s mere anxiety surrounding witchcraft potentially led to the deaths of innocent civilians.</h4>
  <h4>Similarly, during the Red Scare in the 1950s, Americans feared the spread of communism amidst Cold War tensions, which caused many innocent Americans to be accused and convicted of being communists. This phenomenon became known as McCarthyism, the Senator Joseph McCarthy at the end of the movement. Many of McCarthy’s actions to eradicate communism were seen as reckless, as innocent Americans were losing their jobs due to being blacklisted and his attacks even came to include President Eisenhower as well as other U.S. leaders at the time who held public trust. Even one merely in contact with someone who had been accused of being a communist suffered employment issues. Mccarthyism serves as an example of how mass anxiety can lead to irrational actions and decisions, prioritizing the need to soothe fears over the consideration of the factual basis beneath those fears. The drive to eliminate the perceived communist threat overrode the necessity of holding fair trials and garnering evidence, resulting in the unjust persecution of numerous Americans.</h4>
