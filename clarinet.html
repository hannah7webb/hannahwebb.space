  <h2 style="margin-top: 20px; text-align: left;"> biography: </h2>
  <h3 style="margin-top: 12px; text-align: left;"> Hannah is currently a sophomore at Northwestern, pursuing a dual degree in engineering and clarinet performance. She studies under Stephen Williamson, Principal Clarinet of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and Todd Levy, Principal Clarinet of the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra, at the Bienen School of Music. </h3>
  <h3 style="margin-top: 12px; text-align: left;"> Hannah began playing clarinet at age nine through a public school music program in Santa Monica. The following year, she began private study with internationally renowned clarinetist, Amanda Walker, with whom she continued to study for eight years. </h3>
  <h3 style="margin-top: 12px; text-align: left;"> Early opportunities in local ensembles like Elemental Band and SMMUSD Honor Band sparked her passion, and by 6th grade, she was immersed in the John Adams Middle School music program—a key turning point. </h3>
  <h3 style="margin-top: 12px; text-align: left;"> The combination of the fundamental skills and bold artistry Hannah developed under Amanda Walker, along with the rare culture of musical excellence her middle school band director Angela Woo worked to foster, unlocked a relentless drive in her to grow as a musician. </h3>
  <h3 style="margin-top: 12px; text-align: left;"> She was selected to perform with the California All-State Ensembles for six consecutive years, earning first chair statewide in 8th, 10th, and 12th grade. Here, Hannah performed principal parts in works with prominent clarinet features, including Scheherazade, Hebrides Overture, and Danzón No. 2.</h3>
  <h3 style="margin-top: 12px; text-align: left;"> After moving to the suburbs in 8th grade, Hannah transitioned to a school with a smaller music program—a shift that pushed her to actively seek out external opportunities to stay musically engaged and continue growing. Her goal became clear: to practice with such focus and dedication that she could one day join a college community that reflected the vibrant musical environment she had cherished in her early years.</h3>
  <h3 style="margin-top: 12px; text-align: left;"> During this time, Hannah found joy and grounding in performing with high-level youth orchestras such as the Los Angeles Youth Orchestra (LAYO) and Colburn Sinfonietta. Highlights with LAYO include playing principal clarinet on Beethoven's Sixth in 8th grade and Sibelius' Second in Carnegie Hall in 10th. With Colburn, she was featured in a hand-selected woodwind quintet of standout Southern California musicians, performing works of Ibert and Nielsen, and served as principal on Beethoven's Eroica with the Sinfonietta in 12th grade.</h3>
  <h3 style="margin-top: 12px; text-align: left;"> Over high school summers, Hannah attended programs at Idyllwild Arts and Boston University Tanglewood Institute. In a mock audition at Tanglewood's two-week clarinet intensive, David Martins, renowned clarinet pedagogue, and Christopher Elchico, second clarinetist of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, described the opening of Hannah's Mozart Clarinet Concerto as the “most captivating” of the pool. </h3>
  <h3 style="margin-top: 12px; text-align: left;"> The summer before her senior year, Hannah advanced to the final round of the International Clarinet Association's High School Solo Competition, and performed live in Denver for a panel of international professionals. She placed first for the United States and fourth globally.</h3>
  <h3 style="margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: -10px; text-align: left;"> Hannah is especially grateful to her longtime teacher Amanda Walker, whose unwavering support and belief in her shaped not only her playing but her confidence as an artist. Music continues to be one of the deepest sources of joy and meaning in her life. </h3>
